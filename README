Setup requirements
------------------

To be able to run joliebulle you will need to install python3, python3-qt bindings and qt development tools.
On Debian this can be done by running:

	sudo apt install pyqt5-dev-tools python3-qt-dev

Then you will need to generate python modules interfaces from qtWebDesigner files. This can be done thanks to a script in `bin` which call `pyuic5` on the correct files.

	./bin/gen-ui

You should be now able to run the development version of joliebulle:

	cd joliebulle
	python3 main.py
